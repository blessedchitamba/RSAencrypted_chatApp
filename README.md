# RSAencrypted_chatApp
A simple client-server chat app that implements RSA encryption from first principles to encrypt and decrypt chat messages.
Allows a server and client to communicate via the internet using the Java Socket API and with RSA encryption. 

To run, run the server.jar and client.jar (in that order!) on separate terminals (java -jar server.jar) 
Source code is in src/rsa/. 
Messages are sent on the terminal.
